     <h3> Some villagers in Ondo State have </h3>
     <p class="cool-cool">
        Some villagers in Ondo State have begun to flee their homes, following incessant attacks
         suffered from the herdsmen-cum-bandits’ invasion.

        This has become the fate of residents in some villages in 
        the state after longtime reported cases of attacks, kidnappings 
        and sometimes – killings, which have continued to disrupt business
         activities, undermine food security, displace a large number of
          inhabitants, and also cast heavy doubt on the safety of lives and property.
        
        Research has shown that over 4,000 farmers have been killed in the
         South Western part of Nigeria from 2015 to date.
        
        According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, Nigeria
         has lost not less than 8,343 persons to the farmers-herders conflict since 2005.

    <p class="cool-cool">
        This rising invasion of herders in the Southwest region subsequently led the
         governors in the six South-West states, with ranking traditional rulers, to form 
        the Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed ‘Amotekun’ on January 9, 2020.   
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool">
        Despite the support from the state governments, the regional security outfit has continued to struggle to
         maintain and counter persistent attacks from the herdsmen.   
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool" >
        Some residents have raised concerns about the wherewithal of the Amotekun corps to overpower
         and take control of the
         areas that have become dominated by the herdsmen.  
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool">
        Following investigations by The PUNCH, a resident who gave her name
         as Tinu said she stays in Akoko but visits Ifon often and that it is 
         always a scary journey to embark on.

        “I live after Arigidi Akoko but I often commute on the road that leads 
        to Ifon. I have a friend I visit regularly. That road is now lonely,
         Amotekun men have practically been overpowered in that place because it’s like the epicentre of 
        herdsmen. They sacked an entire community,” she said.  
     </p class="cool-cool" >
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool">
        A monarch who didn’t want his name in print said he had to get extra local security to support the 
        Amotekun but that they’re struggling to keep them away.  
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool" >
        Although, the men of the Amotekun security corps didn’t say much about
         the challenges faced, residents gave their views about some of the problems the
         security network encountered in the cause of duty.   
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool" >
        A man who simply gave his name as Joe and a graduate of Adekunle Ajasin
         University, Akungba Akoko, said Amotekun is powerless in certain parts of the
          state and his parents had to abandon
         their home because of the security crisis in their area.   
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="cool-cool" >
        “Which Amotekun? Bandits are killing people in Ose LG every day. Ifon, Okeluse,
         Molege, Arimogijaa communities are no-go areas till today. We even heard Amotekun
          were told to stop fighting the bandits when they lost
           like 5 of their officers in that environment. My parents 
           had to leave the house to go and stay
         with my brother who lives in Ondo town,” he said.

        While travellers have been attacked, killed and kidnapped, the farmers and
         their farmlands too weren’t been spared. From tales of being killed on their
          farms to escaping with injuries and destruction of farmlands, the farmers have had a bitter taste 
        of the precarious security situation of the state.
